Add a helper script, ``scripts/rad.py`` to assist with the management of the RAD resources.
Features include:
- Listing the latest versions of all the RAD resources.
  - includes indications of which resources are "frozen" (not changeable without
    a new version) at the time of script execution.
- Creating (and integrating) a new RAD resource.
  - Includes bumping the manifest version if necessary
- Bumping existing RAD resource versions.
  - Includes solving the cascade of version bumps that maybe required.
- Editing existing RAD resources.
  - Includes bumping the resource (and the cascade of other resources) if the
    edits necessitate a version bump.
